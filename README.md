<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This package provides you with a direct integration to the United Nations (UN) Statistics API, which holds the latest version of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their related Targets and Indicators. A weekly, automated, sync allows the Goals, Targets and Indicators to be upserted into your Salesforce org so that you can link activity to a Goal, Target or Indicator.

Once activity is linked, you can then easily report on your activity against the SDGs! Track your impact and see areas for improvement.
